# Test

You can find the progress log in [track.md](https://github.com/fstovarr/test/blob/development/track.md).

The app is accessible from http://104.154.247.125/auth. You will find default credentials showing the app, but also, if you enter an email that doesn't exist, you can explore all the flow: creating users, looking for companies, and seeing the data.

**Please check out the folder called [docs](https://github.com/fstovarr/test/tree/development/docs)**

## Further work
